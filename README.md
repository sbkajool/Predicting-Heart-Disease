# Predicting Heart Disease: An Analysis of Classification Models

Heart disease encompasses various cardiac conditions, including blockages, rhythm irregularities, and congenital defects. This global health concern, known as cardiovascular disease, leads to heart attacks, muscle problems, and irregular beats.

Predicting heart issues is crucial, given its global impact. Healthcare data, when harnessed through data mining and modern techniques like Machine Learning, can offer insights. The gravity is evident with heart disease causing over 610,000 deaths annually in the US alone, with common types like CHD claiming around 370,000 lives.

Detecting heart disease is complex due to multiple factors like high blood pressure and diabetes. Modern approaches, including Machine Learning, promise improved prediction.

This project employs Machine Learning on a Kaggle dataset to predict heart disease presence.
